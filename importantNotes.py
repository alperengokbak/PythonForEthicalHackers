# Lesson 1

# list = []
# dict = {}
# set = {}
# tuple = ()

#! We can reach some functions like that, list.append(). Type list or other ones. And put the dot.
#! Tuple's value cannot be change after created.
#! Sets value cannot be loop. Display just one time.
#! dict["key1"] = "value1". You can add the value inside the dict.
#! If we want to reach dictionary values, you can write two brackets.
# print(myDictionary4["key3"]["key4"])

#! Slicing
#! Starting second index and display coming from second index.
# print(myString2[2:])
#! Display index until second one.(Stoping point, Stoping index)
# print(myString2[:2])
# print(myString2[3:4])  # Display index third one between fourth one.

#! Step Size
# print(myString2[::2])  # We can define the step size. Growing two by two.
#! Display the whole string, but starting from the end of the string.
# print(myString2[::-1])

#! Lesson 2

#! We use "and" instead of "&&" in Python.
#print(x >= 5 and y >= x)

#! We use "or" instead of "||" in Python.
#print(x >= 5 or y <= x)

#! Lastly, "not" will display the opposite values.
#print(not x == y)


# ! We say formatting, If we want to display the p with string expression, use the "f" in front of first bracket.
# print(f"Value p: {p}")

#! If we want to find remaining from the division. Use "%" expression.
